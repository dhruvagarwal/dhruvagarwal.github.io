## Geekometer
-------------------------

### Introduction
------------------------
Geekometer is a chrome extension for the globally famous website [GeeksForGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org). This site is a huge repository of interview questions. The questions are sorted by various topics like arrays, tress, data structure etc. Since the amount of data on the site is very large it is very difficult to keep the track of questions completed. There is no provision to even mark important or categorise the topics. So we propose to make an extension that would help thousands of students and professionals across the world to keep track of the topics. 

### Technology stack
------------------------
* Chrome Extension Framework
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Django/PhP Server

### Usage
---------------------------

1. First install the chrome Extension from [Geekometer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geekometer/hdmnpbdgkgbmljppdkgbanoemdchephb)

2. Now, you have to simply surf [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and a tooltip will be automatically available on complete website

3. If you think that you have solved a problem , you mark it 'done' on the tooltip , if you think it is important , give it a colour out of the 8 available colours

4. All the links for which you have marked 'important' or 'done', you will see visual changes on complete site. There is always a refresh button for updating the changes if not visible.

5. All these markings hence done , will help you in tracking your progress on the site.

### Future Goals
--------------------------
- [ ] make a new design
- [ ] make a provision for performance graphs
- [ ] set up a server for backups
- [ ] set up new marketting strategies
